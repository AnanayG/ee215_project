# ee215_project
EE215 course project to design two fully-differential high-speed high-precision amplifier.

Each design must satisfy the following specifications:
- Gain = 8
- Differential Output Swing = 1.8 V
- Gain Error < 1%
- CL = 2 pF
- Supply Voltage = 1.8 V

The first design will have a power budget of 20 mW and aims to minimize the large-signal settling
time to 0.5% accuracy. The second design targets a 0.5% large-signal settling time of 40 ns and aims
to minimize the power dissipation
